# Glaucoma-Diagnosis-with-Machine-learning


This is an image processing project to automate the diagnosis of glaucoma from fundus retinal images using machine learning.
The features are extracted from the fundus images using image processing techniques - kurtosis, k-stat, mean, median, standard deviation and the obtained numerical features are stored in a dataset.
Dataset of extracted features from images can be found here: https://drive.google.com/open?id=1A3ur-54W5ObiJ4pln6fXzmuO-1ivlCHw

Machine learning algorithms namely, SVM, KNN, Random Forest, Logistic regression and ensemble learning are then applied on these extracted features and their performance is compared.
